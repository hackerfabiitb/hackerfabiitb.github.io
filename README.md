# HackerFab — Student Microfabrication Lab

A student-built microfabrication initiative to provide hands-on semiconductor training, low-cost tools, and an open learning ecosystem. This README is adapted from the HackerFab pitch deck.

---

## 🚀 Vision
Create an affordable, open-source fabrication toolset and learning environment that produces industry-ready talent and inspires replication across institutes.

**Key pillars:**
- **Exposure** — provide hands-on experience with semiconductor technology.
- **Access** — lower costs and open access to tools, labs, and interdisciplinary projects.
- **Collaboration** — foster teamwork, open learning, and participation in the global HackerFab community.

---

## 🔬 What is HackerFab?
- Student-led team building low-cost fabrication equipment from scratch, following open-source principles.
- Hands-on learning to understand semiconductor physics and process flow.
- Part of a larger international HackerFab community (CMU, UWaterloo, MIT).

---

## 📋 Plan of Action
- **Lithography** — projector & microscope acquired; UV LEDs; UV PCB design; stands & holders in CAD.
- **Spin Coater** — motor and microcontroller acquired; gravity chuck designed and manufactured.
- **Future Tools** — v2/v3 builds, ALD, sputter, tube furnace, and open-source EDA tools.
